    <h1><u>MARKETING AND ECONOMICS</u></h1>
    <h3 class="questions"><b>Annual Consumption and Dollar Value</b></h3>
    <p class="para">Approximately 6,200 pounds of false unicorn were consumed in 2003. Consumption waned to just under 5,000 pounds in 2004 and went up again to 6,000 pounds in 2005. About 80% of the harvest came from wild harvested sources. The dollar value over these three years was about $218,300 in 2003, $243,600 in 2004, and  $239,000 in 2005. These figures are significantly lower than those reported in the late 1990s and early 2000, where consumption reached 13,500 pounds and was valued at about $700,000.</p>
    <h3 class="questions"><b>Supply and Demand</b></h3>
    <p class="para">Demand for false unicorn continues to increase at a slow but steady rate. About 20% of the supply comes from cultivated sources. The heavy harvests in the late 1990s and early 2000s have put a strain on the wild populations, particularly in the southeastern United States.

        A wild harvester can easily collect entire populations in a short period of time. Large harvest volumes can only be consistently achieved with the incorporation of cultivated material into the supply channel.
        
        In recent years, there has also been a rising demand for false unicorn plant starts, either as dormant roots or small plants in flats, for those growers who are attempting to cultivate this plant.</p>
    <h3 class="questions"><b>Distribution Channels</b></h3>
    <p class="para">Buyers of false unicorn are widely dispersed throughout North America and Europe, but suppliers are highly concentrated. Current supplies are wild-harvested on a very small scale throughout its natural range, particularly in the southeastern United States. Experienced brokers and professionals move the material through the supply chain. The market, in terms of pounds, is small relative to other botanicals.</p> 
    <h3 class="questions"><b>Commercial Visibility</b></h3>
    <p class="para">This material does not have a great deal of visibility beyond a small core of botanical users and herbalists, but its visibility is growing stronger. There are only a few companies selling dried false unicorn root. Of the top manufacturers and distributors of nutraceuticals/botanicals in North America and Europe, 8% offer this material as a standalone product, and 11% offer this material as either a standalone product or as part of a multi-constituent supplement.</p>
    <h3 class="questions"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
    <p class="para">Demand for false unicorn continues to increase at a slow but steady rate. Much of the current supply is harvested exclusively from native sites, putting strains on wild populations, particularly in the southeastern United States. An increasing number of buyers, who fear the exploitation of natural populations, are stipulating that the false unicorn they purchase be supplied through cultivation or by sustainable wild-harvest techniques. There is growing support among conservation groups to consider petitioning CITES (Convention for International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to include false unicorn in Appendix II which would put restrictions on international trade.</p>
