        <p><b>Botanical Information</b>
            <br>
            False unicorn or fairy wand [Chamaelirium luteum (L.) A. Gray], member 
            of the Liliaceae family, is native to North America with a natural range 
            stretching from Florida north to New York and west to the Mississippi 
            River.  Most of the significant wild populations of this plant exist in the 
            southern portion of its range.  An herbaceous perennial, its leaves form a 
            basal rosette with an emerging flower stalk that bears either a male or fe
            male flower spike about two feet tall.  Flowering occurs from May to 
            June.  False unicorn likes to grow in moist, acidic soil located in partially 
            to fully shaded areas in meadows, thickets, and rich woods.  Harvesting 
            of the roots usually occurs in autumn, after flowering is complete, and 
            when plants are about four to eight years old.

            <b>Uses and Treatments:-</b>
            <br>
            False unicorn is widely used by North American Indians as a woman's 
            herb. Traditionally, it was used to prevent miscarriage, treat menstrual 
            problems, and to improve fertility.  In Western herbal medicine, it has 
            been used to treat pregnancy problems and ovarian cysts and used as an 
            anti-inflammatory and diuretic.
