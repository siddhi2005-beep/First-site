    <h1><i><b><u>Cultivation Practices</u></b></i></h1>
    <h2 class="questions"><b>Site Selection</b></h2>
    <p class="para">False unicorn grows in rich open woods or under the shade of hardwood trees or a mix of hardwoods and conifers. It prefers a moist, acidic soil that drains well. Cech (2002) recommends a soil pH ranging from 4.5 to 6, with a high humic content. If planting in a natural woods setting, he suggests locating the planting beds in a conifer or mixed hardwood-derived loam, a sandy loam (like in the North Carolina Piedmont region), or bottom land, where leaf mulch does not accumulate. Look for a site where other woodland plants grow, such as Solomon’s seal, lady’s slipper orchid, hepatica, or perhaps a native stand of false unicorn.

        If an open field is used for production, shade structures should be erected. Typically, a wood lath or polypropylene shade structure is used. For artificial shade, make the structure 7 feet tall or higher with two ends open to the prevailing breeze.</p>
    <h2 class="questions"><b>Planting</b></h2>
    <p class="para">Propagation is typically done through seed or root division, although large quantities of seed are not readily available commercially. False unicorn can be propagated by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or in fall. Plants can be started from seed, but the rhizome divisions may allow for a faster harvestable plant. Propagation by seed is more of a challenge.

        The surface of the rhizome is covered with buds, resembling small eyes, that have the ability to produce new growth and roots. Cech recommends cutting rhizomes into sections as narrow as one-quarter inch, leaving the disk-shaped pieces to callus overnight. Cuttings should have at least one eye-like growth bud to allow for new growth to originate. Plant in pots, keeping soil moist and pots shaded until the new plants emerge. In a well-prepared 3-foot wide bed with high organic matter, transplant young plants 6 to 10 inches apart by staggering the plantings. Topdress beds with a light covering of mulch. Cech recommends pine needles, bark mulch, or rotted conifer-derived sawdust. Add mulch as needed throughout the growing season. Plants should be ready to harvest four to six years after planting.
        
        Germinating false unicorn seed may be difficult, and the seed needs to go through a period of cold then warm stratification (Baskin et al. 2001). Baskin et al. (2001) found that germination of false unicorn seed was much higher when seeds were exposed to light. Cech recommends seeding flats with a high organic soil mix comprised of two parts peat moss, one part decomposed pine needles, one part perlite, and one-half part sand. In late fall or early winter, gently sow the newly harvested seed (air dry, not dehydrated) approximately one-eighth of an inch deep in flats or in prepared outdoor, shaded seedbeds. When the seedlings emerge in spring or early summer, Cech suggests leaving the young seedlings undisturbed for at least one growing season before transplanting out into permanent beds. </p>
    <h2 class="questions">Pest Control</h2>
    <p class="para">Weed control is very critical the first few years. This is usually accomplished with mulching and hand-weeding. Currently, there are no herbicides approved for use on this plant.

        Snails and slugs can be pests to this species under moist conditions. If they are a problem, several control methods can be tried, including beer traps, diatomaceous earth, and copper strips. Straw mulch can aggravate the problem if slugs and snails are present. Deer have been observed feeding on the flower stalks. Standard deer control methods can be tried, including fencing or providing an alternative food source. These methods may also be needed if armadillos are in the area. </p>
    <h2 class="questions">Harvesting, Cleaning, and Drying</h2>
    <p class="para">False unicorn is usually harvested in the fall. This allows for the seed to be collected before digging the roots. Since rhizome pieces are small and generally measure less than 3 inches in length, digging is easiest with a spading fork or smaller digging tool. If leaves have been observed to fall off in past years, marking or staking the plant location may be one way to assure finding the plant for harvest.  

        Shake the roots free of dirt and carefully remove roots, making sure they are false unicorn. Mixing other roots with false unicorn adulterates harvest quality, lowers the harvest value, and may make selling it difficult. Protect harvested roots from the sun and heat; do not allow the roots to dry out. 
        
        Because fresh roots are susceptible to mold, keep unwashed roots stored in sphagnum moss until ready to process. Check often to ensure the roots are moist but not wet, and stir the roots to allow for aeration. When ready for processing, it is recommended to wash false unicorn roots with a pressure hose or root washer. Take great care not to damage the roots as they are cleaned and to remove all particles of dirt. 
        
        Once the roots are cleaned, dry the roots in a warm place with adequate airflow. False unicorn roots are quite small and should be dried whole. If a drying unit is not available, a dehydrator, converted greenhouse, or converted rooms in a barn are areas that can be used for drying. Cech recommends drying for one day with low temperature (70°F) and high air flow and then turning up the temperature to 100°F until roots are dried thoroughly. Once the roots are completely dry, put in cardboard boxes, cloth bags, or polypropylene sacks. Store in a cool, dark, and dry location. Stored like this, false unicorn should keep for two to three years.</p>
